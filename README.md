## About the Project  
**Bakes Between Friends** is a community-driven platform where users can share, discover, and interact with recipes. Inspired by *Jakeâ€™s Bakes*, this project expands the love of baking and cooking into an interactive experience where anyone can contribute their favourite recipes.

- Provide an intuitive search feature to help users find recipes based on ingredients or keywords.  
- Offer a responsive and accessible design for seamless use on mobile and desktop.  

### Features (Planned)
- User authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)  
- Recipe submission with title, ingredients, instructions, and images  
- Ability to edit and delete user-owned recipes  
- Search and filter functionality for recipes  
- Like and comment system for community engagement  

### Tech Stack

- **Responsiveness:** Designing for seamless use across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Description


## Agile and User Stories
The project follows Agile methodologies to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement.   
- **Kanban (Project) Board:** In line with Agile methodology, I wrote user stories in the planning and development of our website. The full details of these can be found on our project board.

- **Daily Standups and Standdowns:** Regular updates to report on progress  


## Wireframes
Before starting the project, a couple of basic wireframes were created to visualise the final product. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were developed.



## Features 
The platform includes the following features:  
**Responsive Design** 
The website is responsive and works on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users have a consistent and enjoyable experience regardless of the device they are using. The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing optimal usability and accessibility.
