## Use of AI


This project leverages AI technologies to enhance development and user experience, but only where absolutely necessary:
1. **Code Assistance with GitHub Copilot**:
- GitHub Copilot was utilised to assist in writing, reviewing, and optimising the code.
- It provided intelligent code suggestions, reducing development time and improving code quality.
- This was utilised via automatic suggestions and code reviews

2. **AI-Generated Visual Assets**:
- Header images for the project were generated using ChatGPT's image generation capabilities.
- The favicon icon was also created using AI tools, ensuring a unique and visually appealing design.

3. **Error-checking using AI**:
- I utilised AI (ChatGPT and CoPilot) when struggling with UX on the profile page section of the website. Through using the AI as a discussion-based tool where I could bounce ideas and receive feedback on them, I was able to resolve the problem. This saved me time in the long run rather than just trial and error repeatedly. 

4. **Use of AI to generate commit messages**:
- One feature I found particularly useful was CoPilot's ability to generate commit messages based on the work that I had completed - this made the process smoother, clearer to understand and helped ensure uniformity.

By integrating AI tools into the development process, this project demonstrates the potential of AI in streamlining workflows and enhancing creativity.

- **Automated Testing:** I did not carry out automated testing due to a lack of time

## Deployment  
The project is deployed using the following steps:  
1. **Heroku** 
The site was deployed to Heroku from the main branch of the repository early in the development stage for continuous deployment and checking.

The Heroku app is setup with 3 environment variables, repalcing the environment variables stored in env.py (which doesn't get pushed to github).

In order to create an Heroku app:

1.  Click on New in the Heroku dashboard, and Create new app from the menu dropdown.

2.  Give your new app a unique name, and choose a region, preferably one that is geographically closest to you.

3.  Click "Create app"

4.  In your app settings, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and add the environment variables for your app. These are:

        - DATABASE_URL - your database connection string
        - SECRET_Key - the secret key for your app
        - CLOUDINARY_URL - the cloudinary url for your image store

The PostgreSQL database is served from ElephantSQL

Once the app setup is complete, click on the Deploy tab and:

    1. Connect to the required GitHub account
    2. Select the repository to deploy from
    3. Click the Deploy Branch button to start the deployment.
    4. Once deployment finishes the app can be launched.

The app can be accessed at the following link:[Bakes Between Friends](https://bakes-between-friends-a9965fdf43a6.herokuapp.com/)


2. **Version Control:** 
Code is managed using Git and GitHub.  

The GitHub Repository can be found here: [Bakes Between Friends GitHub](https://github.com/JakeCRichards/BakesBetweenFriends)


## Issues faced
During the development of this project, I faced an unexpected health challenge when I developed kidney stones. This condition caused significant discomfort and made it impossible for me to sit and work on the project for over a week. Despite this setback, I remained determined to complete the project and resumed work as soon as I was able, ensuring that the quality and functionality of the platform were not compromised.

## Known Bugs  

1. **Unauthorized Access to Publish URL:**  
    If a user directly navigates to the `/publish/` URL without having the necessary permissions, the application throws a server error instead of redirecting the user to an appropriate page (e.g., login or error page). This issue will be addressed in a future update to improve error handling and user experience.
