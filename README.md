## About the Project  
**Bakes Between Friends** is a community-driven platform where users can share, discover, and interact with recipes. Inspired by *Jakeâ€™s Bakes*, this project expands the love of baking and cooking into an interactive experience where anyone can contribute their favourite recipes.  

## Initial Plan
### Project Intentions
This project aims to:  
- Create a user-friendly platform for sharing and discovering recipes.  
- Implement full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for recipes.  
- Foster a sense of community by allowing users to like, comment, and engage with shared recipes.  
- Provide an intuitive search feature to help users find recipes based on ingredients or keywords.  
- Offer a responsive and accessible design for seamless use on mobile and desktop.  

### Features (Planned)
- User authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout)  
- Recipe submission with title, ingredients, instructions, and images  
- Ability to edit and delete user-owned recipes  
- Search and filter functionality for recipes  
- Like and comment system for community engagement  

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a Bootstrap framework)  
- **Backend:** Python 
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Heroku  

### User Experience Design  
The design process focuses on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface. Key considerations include:  
- **User Personas:** Identifying target users such as home bakers, professional chefs, and food enthusiasts.  
- **Wireframes:** Initial sketches and prototypes to map out the layout and functionality.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the platform is usable for individuals with disabilities by adhering to WCAG guidelines.  
- **Responsiveness:** Designing for seamless use across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Description


## Agile and User Stories
The project follows Agile methodologies to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement.   
- **Kanban (Project) Board:** In line with Agile methodology, I wrote user stories in the planning and development of our website. The full details of these can be found on our project board.

- **Daily Standups and Standdowns:** Regular updates to report on progress  


## Wireframes
Before starting the project, a couple of basic wireframes were created to visualise the final product. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were developed.


## Entity Relationship Diagram
When planning out the models for this project, I created the following ERD

## Features 
The platform includes the following features:  
**Responsive Design** 
The website is responsive and works on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users have a consistent and enjoyable experience regardless of the device they are using. The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing optimal usability and accessibility.

    - Checked that only the recipe owner can edit or delete their recipes.

- **Automated Testing:** I did not carry out automated testing due to a lack of time

## Deployment  
The project is deployed using the following steps:  
1. **Heroku** 
The site was deployed to Heroku from the main branch of the repository early in the development stage for continuous deployment and checking.

The Heroku app is setup with 3 environment variables, repalcing the environment variables stored in env.py (which doesn't get pushed to github).

In order to create an Heroku app:

1.  Click on New in the Heroku dashboard, and Create new app from the menu dropdown.

2.  Give your new app a unique name, and choose a region, preferably one that is geographically closest to you.

3.  Click "Create app"

4.  In your app settings, click on "Reveal Config Vars" and add the environment variables for your app. These are:

        - DATABASE_URL - your database connection string
        - SECRET_Key - the secret key for your app
        - CLOUDINARY_URL - the cloudinary url for your image store

The PostgreSQL database is served from ElephantSQL

Once the app setup is complete, click on the Deploy tab and:

    1. Connect to the required GitHub account
    2. Select the repository to deploy from
    3. Click the Deploy Branch button to start the deployment.
    4. Once deployment finishes the app can be launched.

The app can be accessed at the following link:[Bakes Between Friends](https://bakes-between-friends-a9965fdf43a6.herokuapp.com/)


2. **Version Control:** Code is managed using Git and GitHub.
